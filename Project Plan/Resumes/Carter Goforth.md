## Introduction
I grew up around the north Atlanta area for essentially my entire life. I started writing little quiz games in notepad when I was still a single digit age, and it eventually lead to me wanting to pursue a career in game developement. As such, my time at KSU has been spent on the *Computer Game Design and Developement* track, finishing up FYE relatively quickly and now diving more into the specific classes still required, like *Intro to Software Developement*.
