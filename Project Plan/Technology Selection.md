# Technology Selection

### Language & Framework
- We have decided to use the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) language and [Spring](https://spring.io/) web framework.
> The team is most comfortable working in Java, and Spring is the only web framework available for it.

### Storage Plan
- We have decide to use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for our storage/database needs.
> The team is most comfortable working in SQL. 

> Many team members either are or have taken a databases class which taught in SQL.   
    
### Operating Environment
- As of now, our software is being designed to work on [Microsoft Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11).
