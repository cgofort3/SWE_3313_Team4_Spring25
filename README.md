# SWE_3313_Team4_Spring25
This is the group repository for Cowboy Clearance, a team composed of 4 students in SWE 3313, Intro to Software Engineering. All of our documentation, code, and presentations should all be available within this repository, and will be updated as the semester progresses.

Our project was to create a web-based shopping system for unique items, in our case cowboy hats! We've decide to use Java coding and Spring.
