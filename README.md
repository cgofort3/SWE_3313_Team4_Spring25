# Cowboy Clearance
Welcome to the Github repository for Cowboy Clearance. Here you will find all code, resources, and presentations either created or used by us for our SWE 3313 class project.

We will create a web-based shopping system for unique items, in our case cowboy hats and other themed accesories, coded using Java and Spring.
