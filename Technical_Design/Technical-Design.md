# Technical Design

### Language & Framework
- We have decided to use the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) language and [Spring](https://spring.io/) web framework.
> The team is most comfortable working in Java, and Spring is the most widely support web development framework for Java
- We are using Thymeleaf as a template engine for our webpages and Bootstrap for our frontend framework
> Thymeleaf makes it easier to design one webpage and populate it with different kinds of data, and Bootstrap allows us to easily add UI elements

### Storage Plan
- We have decide to use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for our storage/database needs.
> The team is most comfortable working in SQL. 
> Many team members either are or have taken a databases class which taught in SQL.   

### Coding Style guide
- [Java Code Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-introduction.html)
- Keep lines to a length of 150 characters or less
- Properly indent all code and include whitespace to increase readability
