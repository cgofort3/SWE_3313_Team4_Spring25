### Language and Framework Selection

## Implementation Language

- **Language**: Java
- **Reason for Selection**:
  - Java is a widely used, mature, and well-documented programming language.
  - It is platform-independent (via the JVM), making it highly portable.
  - Strong support for object-oriented programming, helping structure the system clearly.
  - Extensive libraries and community support for building scalable systems.
- **Useful Resources**:
  - [Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
  - [Java Programming Tutorials (W3Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
  - [Java Tutorials (Oracle)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

## Implementation Frameworks

- **Framework**: Spring Boot (using Java)
- **Reason for Selection**:
  - Spring Boot simplifies Java backend development with built-in tools for web applications, security, and database access.
  - It allows for rapid application development with minimal configuration.
  - Highly scalable and commonly used in industry-level projects.
- **Useful Resources**:
  - [Spring Boot Documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  - [Spring Boot Tutorial (Baeldung)](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot)
- We are using Thymeleaf as a template engine for our webpages and Bootstrap for our frontend framework
> Thymeleaf makes it easier to design one webpage and populate it with different kinds of data, and Bootstrap allows us to easily add UI elements

## Storage Plan
- We have decide to use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for our storage/database needs.
> The team is most comfortable working in SQL. 
> Many team members either are or have taken a databases class which taught in SQL.   

## Coding Style guide
- [Java Code Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-introduction.html)
- Keep lines to a length of 150 characters or less
- Properly indent all code and include whitespace to increase readability
