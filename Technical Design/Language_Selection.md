# Technical Design: Introduction

At this stage, we have spent significant time planning, researching, and prototyping our project. We now have a strong understanding of how we will implement the core components of the system. This technical design document outlines the critical technologies we will use, including the programming language, frameworks, and key resources to support development.

## Implementation Language

- **Language**: Java
- **Reason for Selection**:
  - Java is a widely used, mature, and well-documented programming language.
  - It is platform-independent (via the JVM), making it highly portable.
  - Strong support for object-oriented programming, helping structure the system clearly.
  - Extensive libraries and community support for building scalable systems.
- **Useful Resources**:
  - [Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
  - [Java Programming Tutorials (W3Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
  - [Java Tutorials (Oracle)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

## Implementation Framework

- **Framework**: Spring Boot (using Java)
- **Reason for Selection**:
  - Spring Boot simplifies Java backend development with built-in tools for web applications, security, and database access.
  - It allows for rapid application development with minimal configuration.
  - Highly scalable and commonly used in industry-level projects.
- **Useful Resources**:
  - [Spring Boot Documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  - [Spring Boot Tutorial (Baeldung)](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot)
